1. Install/extract the following

[VCForPython27.msi](/Chowdren/Files/VCForPython27.msi)

# WARNING ❗

Don't forget to cd to the correct directory otherwise its going to complain about missing modules

Make the output dir inside the Chowdren dir and as for the place it pulls the exe from it doesnt even matter

2. Run 

```
python -m chowdren.run <exename> <outdir>
```

It should convert the game's assets to `Assets.dat` format and generate bunch of .cpp files

3.

PS this shit broken af and the only game that kinda works seems to be fnaf2 lmaooooo
